<h1> The Internet Archive</h1>
<p>The Internet Archive (archive.org) is an American digital library with the mission to bring universal access to all knowledge. 
It was founded in 1996 but wasn’t available to the general public until 2001. It provides free access to collections of digitalized materials, 
from websites to millions of books. It holds currently over 20 million books and texts, 3 million movies and videos, 400000 software programs, 
7 million audio files and 463 billion web pages in the Wayback Machine.</p>

<body>
<p>The Internet Archive works by allowing the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, 
although the bulk of data is automatically collected by its web crawlers which try to preserve as much as the web of possible. 
It also has a web archive- <em>‘the Wayback Machine’</em> which contains hundreds of billions of web captures.</p>

<p>The website itself has a clean, simple layout with an option to search on the homepage. 
   There’s also the option to search through 
‘Top Collections at the Archive’ such as Community Audio, American Libraries, Community Images etc. After clicking on Community audio 
there are options that allow you to filter out your options by media type, year, topic & subjects, collection and many more. 
You are also able to see how many views each individual file has.</p>


<p>This website can be a good resource academics and people in need of information about certain topics and there are millions of books, 
for example I searched for books on ‘Buddhism’ and 33,365 results were found for that topic alone.</p>
