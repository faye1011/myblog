    <h1>Mahmoud Darwish Foundation</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>According to the website, the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation was established as a national institution based 
on the presidential decree issued in Ramallah on 4/10/2008. It's named after a Palestinian refugee who 
is regarded as the Palestinian national poet, who won numerous awards for his work.</p>

<p>The website is for the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation but also has a section for the museum. 
Baring in mind the original website is in Arabic and allows for google translate to translate it to English.
 It should also be noted that when entering the website at the bottom a display comes up which says 
 <em>‘this copy from the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation and Museum website is a trial version and work is underway to develop it.’ </em> 
 suggesting there may be faults within the website. The museum aims to display some memorabilia of the
  deceased, including manuscripts and private collections. In real life it is a cultural complex park 
  located in Ramallah- Masyoun- opposite the Palace of Ramallah Cultural on top a hill looking over 
  Jerusalem. It consists of a multi-purpose hall, a library, Mahmoud Darwish Museum, an outdoor summer 
  theatre and the free pulpit space, in addition to the mausoleum and the public garden.</p>

  <h3> Virtual Museum</h3>
<p>Within the museum website there is a 3d tour which is a YouTube video that takes you through the gardens of 
the museum. There is also another 3d tour which takes you through the different rooms in the museum with
 narrows to navigate. There are objects you can click on and it gives you more information, 
 however I found that these bits of information could not be translated into English. 
 The 3d tour also takes you to the main room of the museum where you can see many objects displayed and 
  to find out more information about them you can click on the picture icon in front of them, however you
 cannot move around closer to the objects. If you are able to click on them, it will bring up an enlarged
  photo of the object with a description.</p>
